Special member functions likey to be generated by compilers are 

- default constructor
- destructor
- copy constructor
- copy assignment
- move constructor
- move assignment

Generated functions are implicitly public and inline. They are non-virtual unless it is a destructor in a derived class inheriting from a base class with virtual destructor.

Copy operations perform `memberwise` copy on non-static data of the class and its base parts.
Move operations perform `memberwise` move on non-static data of the class and its base parts.

when compiler figures out the `memberwise` operations are not appropriate, then it will not generate the func.

Declaring a copy ctor does not prevent the compiler from generating a copy assignment operator, and vice versa. But declaring a copy operationprevents the compiler from generating move operations. Because if `memberwise` copy is not appropriate, then the compoiler figures that there is no reason that `memberwise` move is appropriate. 

And the two move operations are not independent like the two copy operations, declaring one prevents the compiler from generating the other.
