<p>Special member functions likey to be generated by compilers are</p>

<ul>
  <li>default constructor</li>
  <li>destructor</li>
  <li>copy constructor</li>
  <li>copy assignment</li>
  <li>move constructor</li>
  <li>move assignment</li>
</ul>

<p>Generated functions are implicitly public and inline. They are non-virtual unless it is a destructor in a derived class inheriting from a base class with virtual destructor.</p>

<p>Copy operations perform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memberwise</code> copy on non-static data of the class and its base parts.
Move operations perform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memberwise</code> move on non-static data of the class and its base parts.</p>

<p>when compiler figures out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memberwise</code> operations are not appropriate, then it will not generate the func.</p>

<p>Declaring a copy ctor does not prevent the compiler from generating a copy assignment operator, and vice versa. But declaring a copy operationprevents the compiler from generating move operations. Because if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memberwise</code> copy is not appropriate, then the compoiler figures that there is no reason that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memberwise</code> move is appropriate.</p>

<p>And the two move operations are not independent like the two copy operations, declaring one prevents the compiler from generating the other.</p>
