`static`, `inline`, `extern`,  `thread_local` 

## static
### static in class
when the keyword `static` is used to the class member in c++, it means the static member belongs to the class and can be accessed by all the instantiated objects. `static` func can only access other static member because they don't know the `this` pointer that points to each object.

```c++
class Myclass {
    private:
        static int cnt;
        const static int tot = 10;
    public:
        static void Incr(int add) {
            cnt += add;
        }
};
int Myclass::cnt = 0;   // static  mem var should be initialized out of the class and explicitly
```
`static` variables are located in the data segement of address space, so their lifetime is same as the programe. 

### static acts on general func
